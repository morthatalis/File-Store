# intro
hey!
idk if this is easy to follow. but if you get stuck post it on issues.  
anyways, this is my terrible file storing service.  
i might add features like adding usernames and passwords to delete items  
but those feature..s that i might add are for future me to have coding nightmares on, not current me.  
anyways, dont use this for top secret information because this aint secure.  
dont sue me if your instance somehow gets hacked.
# instructions on how to install & run
nodejs and npm cuz idc about anything else.
### clone and install packages and also running it
open your terminal and type in:
```
git clone https://github.com/morthatalis/File-Store/ File-Store
cd File-Store  
npm install
```

to start the server type in:

```node server.js```

that's actually everything!
if you use a server hoster like render or vercel then
you have to manually figure out database, use mongodb or something.
you gotta fork this if you wanna do database. cuz otherwise you cant,
