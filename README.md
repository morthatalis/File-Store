# intro
hey!
idk if this is easy to follow. but if you get stuck post it on issues.  
anyways, this is my terrible file storing service.  
i might add features like adding usernames and passwords to delete items  
but those feature..s that i might add are for future me to have coding nightmares on, not current me.  
anyways, dont use this for top secret information because this aint secure.  
dont sue me if your instance somehow gets hacked.
# instructions on how to install & run
nodejs and npm cuz idc about anything else.
1. open your terminal and type in (multer itself doesnt work for me. but if you care too much, try to use multer directly):
```
git clone https://github.com/morthatalis/File-Store/ File-Store
cd File-Store  
npm init -y
npm install express
npm install multer@1.4.5-lts.1
```

run:
```node server.js```
